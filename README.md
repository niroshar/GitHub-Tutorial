# Creating a Word Cloud
A word cloud is an image that consists of words to describe the how important these words in a certain blog. The size of each word represents the importantance of that word or mostly available word in the article (the word with the highest frequency will be the biggest size in the word cloud).

People typically use word clouds to easily produce a summary of large documents (reports, speeches), to create art on a topic (gifts, displays) or to visualise data (tables, surveys).

This repository includes R code for creating a wordcloud removing and eliminating special characters and specific words in the document. The wordcloud is created using the article posted on 03/17/2018 in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/florida-bridge-collapse-crack.html).
